# Pickleball Tournament Platform - Project Tasks

## Tournament Bracket Enhancement

### Requirements

1. Enhance bracket generation and visualization with team/player coding
   - Assign code numbers to teams/players (A1, B2, etc. for group stage)
   - Show TBD matches as "A1 vs B2" for future matches
   - Implement coding for knockout stage (1, 2, 3, 4 for quarter matches)
   - Display 1 vs 2 for incomplete semi matches
   - Make sure bracket styling matches PPA bracket reference images

2. Implement seeding functionality
   - Create a page for organizers to view the participant list with their seeds
   - Allow organizers to drag and drop teams/players to different seeds
   - Implement back-end to store and use the seed changes

3. Implement tiebreak rules for groups
   - Primary: Head-to-head record with other tied players
   - Secondary: Number of points
   - Update the group standing calculation logic

4. Add support for byes in brackets
   - Handle scenarios where 2 teams per group from 5 groups advance (10 players in round of 16) (The numbers given is just an example, please handle generically for all cases)
   - Give top 6 seeds byes to quarters (free entry) (The numbers given is just an example, please handle generically for all cases)
   - Implement the logic for bye allocation

5. Simplify category configuration
   - Make it so only number of groups and teams advancing per group are necessary
   - Calculate teams per group programmatically
   - Update the relevant templates and routes

6. Implement bulk match editing
   - Create an interface for organizers to edit multiple matches at once
   - Add a confirmation step for review before saving changes

### Current Progress

‚ùì = Not started  
üîÑ = In progress  
‚úÖ = Completed

‚úÖ Implement team/player coding system in brackets
‚úÖ Create match visualization with code-based future matches (A1 vs B2)
‚úÖ Implement knockout stage coding (1, 2, 3, 4)
‚úÖ Update bracket visualization to match PPA bracket design
‚ùì Create seeding UI for drag and drop functionality
‚ùì Implement back-end for storing seed changes
‚ùì Update tiebreaking logic for group standings
‚ùì Implement bye logic for incomplete brackets
‚úÖ Simplify category configuration inputs
‚ùì Implement bulk match editing functionality
‚ùì Add confirmation step for bulk edits

### Implementation Tasks Breakdown

#### 1. Team/Player Coding System

- ‚úÖ Update the `tournament.py` helpers to assign codes based on group/position
- ‚úÖ Modify the bracket generation code to include these codes
- ‚úÖ Update `bracket.html` template to show codes for TBD matches
- ‚úÖ Update `bracket-visualization.js` to handle and display codes
- ‚úÖ Create thorough unit and integration tests _generate_cross_group_seeding in `tournament.py`.

#### 2. Seeding Interface

- ‚ùì Create new route and template for seeding management
- ‚ùì Implement drag and drop UI with JavaScript
- ‚ùì Update the back-end to store the seed changes
- ‚ùì Integrate with existing bracket generation code

#### 3. Tiebreak Implementation

- ‚ùì Update the `_calculate_group_positions` method in `bracket_service.py`
- ‚ùì Add head-to-head comparison as primary tiebreaker
- ‚ùì Use point differential as secondary tiebreaker
- ‚ùì Add tests for the new tiebreaking logic

#### 4. Bye Logic

- ‚ùì Update bracket generation in `tournament.py` to handle byes
- ‚ùì Modify the visualization to properly display byes
- ‚ùì Ensure the top seeds get byes when appropriate

#### 5. Simplified Category Configuration

- ‚úÖ Update category registration logic to calculate teams per group
- ‚úÖ Modify `category_routes.py` to handle the simplified inputs
- ‚úÖ Update `tournament.py` to calculate teams per group

#### 6. Bulk Match Editing

- ‚ùì Design and implement UI for editing multiple matches
- ‚ùì Create new route for handling bulk updates
- ‚ùì Add confirmation step before applying changes
- ‚ùì Update templates and JavaScript for the new functionality

### Notes

- Reference the PPA bracket images for design inspiration
- Look at existing bracket generation logic in `tournament.py` and `bracket_service.py`
- Build upon the existing code where possible
- Add tests for all new functionality

### Recent Updates

- Added support for generating knockout brackets without completed group stage
- Enhanced position codes for all rounds of knockout matches, not just semis and finals
- Added automatic code generation for TBD matches in all tournament rounds
- Added test to verify knockout bracket generation works without completed group standings
- All TBD matches now display appropriate position codes (e.g., "A1 vs B2", "QF1 vs QF2")
